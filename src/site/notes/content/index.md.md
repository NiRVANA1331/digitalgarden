# The Axiomatic Self

> *"I am not a hypothesis. I am not up for proof. I am given — and from here, all else follows."*

This site isn’t a portfolio. It’s not optimized for aesthetics or performance.

What lives here is unfinished, uncertain, and absolutely mine.  
Notes that are raw, half-formed, possibly wrong.  
Experiments that may lead nowhere.  
Observations that don’t yet fit into a paper or a proof.

But they’re real. And I care about them.  
And that alone is reason enough to let them exist — in the open.

This is a record of a mind unfolding on its own terms.

Welcome.
