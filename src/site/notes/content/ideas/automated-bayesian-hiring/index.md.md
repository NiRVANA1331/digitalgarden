# Automated Bayesian Hiring Predictor

_Status_: In Progress  
_Last Updated_: May 31, 2025  
_Tags_: #in-progress #bayesian #ml #careers  

---

## Overview  
Can we build a system that estimates your probability of getting hired into a specific role based on previous applicant data ‚Äî especially their outcomes and portfolios ‚Äî and compare that with your own?

---

## Motivation  
Hiring feels noisy and opaque. But over time, patterns emerge.  
If we had access to historical data ‚Äî who applied, what their CVs looked like, who got offers ‚Äî could we model this probabilistically?  
Even without full data, can we prototype the mechanics of such a system?

## First Thoughts  
![](/img/user/content/ideas/automated-bayesian-hiring/bays.png)
- Bayes' theorem is natural for this: updating belief in acceptance probability given similarity to successful applicants.  
- Inputs:  
  - Your CV vector  
  - Past applicants‚Äô CVs  
  - Outcomes (offer/reject)  
- Could use vector embeddings (e.g. from resumes) and similarity metrics  
- Open questions:  
  - How do we simulate historical data?
  - How do we define ‚ÄúCV similarity‚Äù in a useful way?

## üìà Version History

### v0.1 ‚Äî May 31, 2025  
Initial outline and hypothesis.

---

## Work Log

### [May 31, 2025]  
Wrote project outline. Considering embedding models to represent CVs.  
Thinking about how to define a ‚Äúprior‚Äù over acceptance rates.

---

## Technical Notes  
- Consider using cosine similarity over document embeddings  
- Logistic regression or simple Bayes classifier as baseline  
- Could try a probabilistic programming framework (e.g., Pyro)

---

## Next Steps  
- Write simulation code for past applicants and outcomes  
- Explore embedding approaches for resume text  
- Sketch a naive Bayes-style formulation
