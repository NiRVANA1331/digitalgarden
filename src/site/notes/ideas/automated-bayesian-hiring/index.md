# ðŸ¤– Automated Bayesian Hiring

What would it look like to evaluate candidates not based on fixed thresholds but probabilistic confidence updates?

This note explores a hiring model where beliefs are updated as data accumulates â€” similar to particle filters or Bayesian networks.

## Key Ideas

- Replace fixed rubrics with evolving belief states
- Incorporate uncertainty in candidate attributes
- Design decision thresholds that adapt based on hiring pool quality
