And I care about them.\nAnd that alone is reason enough to let them exist — in the open.\nThis is a record of a mind unfolding on its own terms.\nWelcome.",

		"content": "Automated Bayesian Hiring Predictor\nStatus: In Progress\nLast Updated: May 31, 2025\nTags: #in-progress #bayesian #ml #careers\n\nOverview\nCan we build a system that estimates your probability of getting hired into a specific role based on previous applicant data — especially their outcomes and portfolios — and compare that with your own?\n\nMotivation\nHiring feels noisy and opaque. But over time, patterns emerge.\nIf we had access to historical data — who applied, what their CVs looked like, who got offers — could we model this probabilistically?\nEven without full data, can we prototype the mechanics of such a system?\n\nFirst Thoughts\n\nBayes' theorem is natural for this: updating belief in acceptance probability given similarity to successful applicants.\nInputs:\n\nYour CV vector\nPast applicants’ CVs\nOutcomes (offer/reject)\n\nCould use vector embeddings (e.g. from resumes) and similarity metrics\nOpen questions:\n\nHow do we simulate historical data?\nHow do we define “CV similarity” in a useful way?\n\n📈 Version History\nv0.1 — May 31, 2025\nInitial outline and hypothesis.\n\nWork Log\n[May 31, 2025]\nWrote project outline. Considering embedding models to represent CVs.\nThinking about how to define a “prior” over acceptance rates.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nConsider using cosine similarity over document embeddings\nLogistic regression or simple Bayes classifier as baseline\nCould try a probabilistic programming framework (e.g., Pyro)\n\nNext Steps\n\nWrite simulation code for past applicants and outcomes\nExplore embedding approaches for resume text\nSketch a naive Bayes-style formulation",
