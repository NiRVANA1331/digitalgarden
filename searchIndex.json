		"content": "Automated Bayesian Hiring Predictor\nStatus: In Progress\nLast Updated: May 31, 2025\nTags: #in-progress #bayesian #ml #careers\n\nOverview\nCan we build a system that estimates your probability of getting hired into a specific role based on previous applicant data ‚Äî especially their outcomes and portfolios ‚Äî and compare that with your own?\n\nMotivation\nHiring feels noisy and opaque. But over time, patterns emerge.\nIf we had access to historical data ‚Äî who applied, what their CVs looked like, who got offers ‚Äî could we model this probabilistically?\nEven without full data, can we prototype the mechanics of such a system?\n\nFirst Thoughts\n\nBayes' theorem is natural for this: updating belief in acceptance probability given similarity to successful applicants.\nInputs:\n\nYour CV vector\nPast applicants‚Äô CVs\nOutcomes (offer/reject)\n\nCould use vector embeddings (e.g. from resumes) and similarity metrics\nOpen questions:\n\nHow do we simulate historical data?\nHow do we define ‚ÄúCV similarity‚Äù in a useful way?\n\nüìà Version History\nv0.1 ‚Äî May 31, 2025\nInitial outline and hypothesis.\n\nWork Log\n[May 31, 2025]\nWrote project outline. Considering embedding models to represent CVs.\nThinking about how to define a ‚Äúprior‚Äù over acceptance rates.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nConsider using cosine similarity over document embeddings\nLogistic regression or simple Bayes classifier as baseline\nCould try a probabilistic programming framework (e.g., Pyro)\n\nNext Steps\n\nWrite simulation code for past applicants and outcomes\nExplore embedding approaches for resume text\nSketch a naive Bayes-style formulation",
